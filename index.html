            Bar Nicholas is a home bar ran by me, Nicholas Hubbard, and my fiancee Hayley Ping. We started and are located
            in the heart of Seattle, Washington. We take inspiration from many of the wonderful local restaurants and cocktail bars around us
            such as Bathtub Gin, Zig Zag Cafe, and Champagne Diner. We also also have a passion for local breweries such as 
            Cloudburst Brewing and Holy Mountain Brewery, and always keep a couple of beers on hand from them. 
            Wine is also a focus at Bar Nicholas, and we enjoying discovering and serving Washington wine. As you can tell,
            Bar Nicholas is a place to enjoy a delicious craft cocktail, quaff a cold refreshing beer, and discover your new favorite
            wine, all within the friendly confines of our home.

            The goal at Bar Nicholas is to ensure everyone finds something they love and learns the story of how it got
            into their hands. We do this by maintaining an eclectic selection of beers, wines, whiskies, and liqueurs; researching
            and learning the story of everything we bring in or the cocktails we make; and by encouraging an open minded atmosphere
            around trying new drinks outside of our guests comfort zones. We also operate ot no cost to our patrons, to further
            encourage trying new experiences.
