            Welcome to Bar Nicholas, the coolest home bar in Seattle, owned and operated by the dynamic duo, Nicholas Hubbard and Hayley Ping. 
            Located in the heart of the city, we take inspiration from the hottest local restaurants and cocktail bars like 
            Bathtub Gin, Zig Zag Cafe, and Champagne Diner.

            Our passion for locally brewed beer is second to none, and we always keep a few cold ones from Cloudburst Brewing
            and Holy Mountain Brewery on hand. And if you're more of a wine enthusiast, fear not!
            We have an extensive selection of Washington wines that are sure to delight your palate.

            At Bar Nicholas, we're all about discovering new and delicious drinks in a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere.
            Whether you're in the mood for a craft cocktail, a refreshing beer, or a delightful glass of wine, we've got you covered.
            So come on down, kick back, and let us show you why Bar Nicholas is the coolest spot in town to quench your thirst!

            Welcome to Bar Nicholas, where our goal is not just to serve drinks, but to take you on a journey of discovery. We believe that everyone
            should find something to love on our menu, and that's why we maintain a wide-ranging selection of beers, wines, whiskies, and liqueurs.
            But it's not just about what's in the glass - it's about the story behind it. That's why we put in the time and effort to research and
            learn the story of everything we bring in or the cocktails we make.

            But we don't stop there. At Bar Nicholas, we believe in encouraging an open-minded atmosphere around trying new drinks outside of our guests' comfort zones. 
            Our bartender()s are always ready to introduce you to something you've never tried before, whether it's a classic cocktail with a modern 
            twist or a brand new spirit that's just hit the market. And the best part? We operate at no cost to our patrons, so there's no reason not to step outside 
            of your usual routine and try something new.

            So come on in, sit down, and let us take you on a journey of discovery. 
            At Bar Nicholas, there's always something new to try and a story to learn.
