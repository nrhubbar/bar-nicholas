            Welcome to Bar Nicholas, the coolest home bar in Seattle, owned and operated by the dynamic duo, Nicholas Hubbard and Hayley Ping. 
            Located in the heart of the city, we take inspiration from the hottest local restaurants and cocktail bars like 
            Bathtub Gin, Zig Zag Cafe, and Roquette.

            Our passion for locally brewed beer is second to none, and we always keep a few cold ones from Cloudburst Brewing
            and Holy Mountain Brewery on hand. And if you're more of a wine enthusiast, fear not!
            We have an extensive selection of Washington wines that are sure to delight your palate.

            At Bar Nicholas, we're all about discovering new and delicious drinks in a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere.
            Whether you're in the mood for a craft cocktail, a refreshing beer, or a delightful glass of wine, we've got you covered.
